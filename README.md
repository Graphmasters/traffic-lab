## Verkehrsexperiment May 2022

The traffic experiment conducted on May 10th, 2022 at 16:40 CEST showed the influence of route choice on the 
total travel time of a fleet of vehicles during the rush hour in Hanover, Germany. 
Circa 40 vehicles were driving from the same start location to a common destination. 
The vehicles were starting consecutively from a parking lot.
Every second vehicle was following the route guidance of Google Maps and every other vehicle was using NUNAV Navigation.

- The experiment is described in the paper:
[Analysing the Influence of Route Choice on Traffic Flow with Speed Profiles](route-choice/report.md) 
- The [route-choice](route-choice) directory contains the recorded GPS trajectories.
